# About this demo

This demo is a set of banners developed for Microsoft to promote the launch of new laptops. In reality this was also a promotion of HTML5 support in Internet Explorer and the ability to use the new technology in banners. I had to invent a custom sequence player to make it happen because the CSS3 support in IE was so poor.
The banners were produced in 2012.

The website may no longer be available online in it's original form. It is shared here, in this form, as an example of the frontend work I have done over the years.

This demo only exposes the source code that was online at the time of launch, and as such publicly available. 
It is published here with the same copyright as for the original website.
